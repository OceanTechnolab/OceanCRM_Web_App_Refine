## 🎓 What Are Lead Generation Forms?

Lead Generation forms are Facebook's built-in forms that allow people to express interest in your business without leaving Facebook. When someone clicks your ad or link, a pre-filled form pops up making it super easy for them to submit their information.

### Why Use Them?

- ✅ **Pre-filled data** - Facebook auto-fills name, email, phone from user's profile
- ✅ **Mobile-optimized** - Works perfectly on phones
- ✅ **No landing page needed** - Form is hosted by Facebook
- ✅ **Higher conversion** - Less friction = more leads
- ✅ **Direct CRM integration** - That's what you're building!

## 📋 Minimum Requirements for a Form

To create a functional lead form, you need:

1. **A Facebook Page** (not personal profile)
   - You must be an admin of the Page

2. **Privacy Policy URL**
   - Example: `https://yourwebsite.com/privacy`
   - Use the PRIVACY_POLICY_TEMPLATE.md from this project

3. **At least 1 field to collect**
   - Recommended: Name + Email (minimum)

4. **Thank you message**
   - What users see after submitting

That's it! Forms are free to create.

## 💰 Do I Need to Run Ads?

### Short Answer: No (for testing)

You can create forms without running ads. However:

**To test the full integration:**

- Create a small test ad campaign ($5-10)
- Target a tiny audience (your city, 100-1000 people)
- Run for 1-2 days
- Submit the form yourself
- Verify it imports into your CRM

**Cost**: ~$5-10 total for testing

---

## 🧪 Testing Without Ads

You can test forms directly:

1. Create form in Forms Library
2. Click "Preview" on your form
3. Submit it as a test
4. Check if it appears in "Leads" tab
5. Then import to CRM

**Note**: Preview submissions might not always import to CRM the same way as real submissions do.
