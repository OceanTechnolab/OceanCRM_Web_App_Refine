# Facebook Lead Import - Testing Guide

## üß™ Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Setup Verification ‚úÖ

#### Test 1: SDK Loading

**Objective**: Verify Facebook SDK loads correctly

## üîç Debugging Tools

### 1. Facebook Graph API Explorer

**URL**: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/

**Use For**:

- Testing API calls manually
- Checking permission grants
- Debugging token issues
- Viewing exact API responses

**How to Use**:

1. Select your app from dropdown
2. Generate access token with required permissions
3. Test API endpoints:
   - `/me` - User info
   - `/me/accounts` - Pages list
   - `/{page-id}/leadgen_forms` - Lead forms
   - `/{form-id}/leads` - Lead submissions

---

### 2. Access Token Debugger

**URL**: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/

**Use For**:

- Checking token validity
- Viewing granted permissions
- Seeing token expiration time
- Debugging permission errors

**How to Use**:

1. Copy access token from browser console
2. Paste into debugger

### 3. Browser Console Logging

Add this to your component for detailed debugging:

```typescript
// Add after each API call
console.log("FB Token:", userToken);
console.log("Pages Response:", data);
console.log("Forms Response:", forms);
console.log("Granted Permissions:", response.authResponse.grantedScopes);
```

---

### 4. Network Tab Inspection

**Monitor**:

- API calls to `graph.facebook.com`
- Response status codes
- Response payloads
- Request headers (check access token)

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "This app is in Development Mode"

**Cause**: App not submitted for review or not approved yet  
**Solution**: This is expected! Only admins/developers/testers can use it. Submit for App Review when ready.

### Issue: "pages_show_list permission not granted"

**Cause**: Permission not approved by Facebook  
**Solution**:

1. Check App Review status in Facebook Developers
2. If rejected, review feedback and resubmit
3. In development, ensure you're an app admin

### Issue: No leads showing up after import

**Cause**: Multiple possible reasons  
**Debug Steps**:

1. Check if leads exist in Facebook Ads Manager
2. Verify correct form ID selected
3. Check backend API logs
4. Verify CRM database connection
5. Check data mapping logic

### Issue: "Invalid OAuth Redirect URI"

**Cause**: Redirect URI not whitelisted  
**Solution**: Add your URL to "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" in Facebook Login settings
